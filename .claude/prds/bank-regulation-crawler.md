# PRD: Bank Regulation Crawler

## Executive Summary

The Bank Regulation Crawler is an automated system designed to collect, monitor, and manage regulatory documents from Chinese financial regulatory authorities. It addresses critical compliance challenges by providing real-time alerts for new regulations, maintaining historical tracking, and enabling efficient document retrieval for the Bank of China's Legal Compliance Department. The system will automate the manual process of monitoring multiple regulatory websites, reducing the risk of missing important regulatory changes and improving compliance response times.

## Problem Statement

4. **Difficult Historical Document Retrieval** - Finding past regulations and tracking their evolution is time-consuming
5. **Slow Compliance Response** - Manual processes hinder the ability to respond quickly to regulatory changes

### Impact
- Increased compliance risk exposure
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Potential regulatory penalties for non-compliance
- Competitive disadvantage due to slower response times
