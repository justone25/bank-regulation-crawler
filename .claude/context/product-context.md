# Product Context

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Software Developers** - Using Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- **Team Leads** - Managing development workflows and team coordination
- **Project Managers** - Tracking progress and managing requirements
- **Solo Developers** - Needing structure and organization for personal projects

### Secondary Users
- **DevOps Engineers** - Integrating with existing CI/CD workflows
- **Technical Writers** - Documenting features and requirements
- **QA Engineers** - Understanding test coverage and requirements
- **Product Owners** - Defining and prioritizing features

## User Personas

### The Structured Developer
- **Profile**: Experienced developer who values organization
- **Needs**: Clear requirements, traceable changes, structured workflow
- **Pain Points**: Losing context between sessions, unclear requirements
- **Goals**: Ship quality code with full documentation

### The Team Coordinator
- **Profile**: Tech lead managing multiple developers/AI agents
- **Needs**: Visibility into all work, conflict prevention, progress tracking
- **Pain Points**: Coordinating parallel work, maintaining consistency
- **Goals**: Efficient team utilization, predictable delivery

### The Solo Builder
- **Profile**: Individual developer building complex features
- **Needs**: Structure without overhead, context preservation
- **Pain Points**: Remembering decisions, maintaining momentum
- **Goals**: Build systematically without getting lost

## Core Functionality

### 1. Spec-Driven Development
- Comprehensive PRD creation through guided brainstorming
- Technical implementation planning
- Task decomposition with acceptance criteria
- Full traceability from idea to code

### 2. Parallel Execution
- Multiple AI agents working simultaneously
- Context isolation between work streams
- Coordinated through Git commits
- Non-blocking parallel development

### 3. GitHub Integration
- Issues as project database
- Parent-child relationships for epics
- Comments as audit trail
- Labels for organization

### 4. Context Management
- Persistent context across sessions
- Hierarchical context organization
- Automatic context loading
- Optimized for minimal usage

## Use Cases

### 1. Feature Development
```
User creates PRD → System generates technical plan → 
Tasks decomposed → Pushed to GitHub → Parallel execution → 
Tracking and updates → Feature complete
```

### 2. Bug Fixing
```
Issue identified → Root cause analysis → 
Fix implementation → Testing → Documentation → 
Deployment verification
```

### 3. Project Maintenance
```
Regular context updates → Progress tracking → 
Blocked task identification → Standup reporting → 
System validation and cleanup
```

### 4. Team Collaboration
```
Multiple developers → Shared context → 
Parallel work streams → Conflict prevention → 
Progress visibility → Knowledge sharing
```

## Success Criteria

### User Experience
- Easy to install and set up (< 2 minutes)
- Intuitive command structure
- Clear documentation and examples
- Minimal learning curve

### Technical Excellence
- Reliable operation across environments
- Efficient resource usage
- Secure and private operation
- Maintainable and extensible code

### Business Value
- Reduced context switching (89% less time lost)
- Increased parallel execution (5-8 tasks vs 1)
- Lower bug rates (75% reduction)
- Faster delivery (up to 3x improvement)
