# Project Brief

## Project Overview

**Claude Code PM System** - A comprehensive workflow management system designed to enhance AI-assisted software development through spec-driven development, GitHub integration, and parallel AI agent execution.

## What It Does

The system transforms how developers work with AI by providing:
1. **Structured Workflow** - 5-phase process from idea to production
2. **Context Preservation** - Never lose project state between sessions
3. **Parallel Execution** - Multiple AI agents working simultaneously
4. **Full Traceability** - Complete audit trail from requirement to code
5. **GitHub Native** - Uses Issues as project management database

## Why It Exists

### Problem Statement
Traditional AI-assisted development suffers from:
- **Context Evaporation** - Project understanding lost between sessions
- **Serial Bottlenecks** - One task at a time limits velocity
- **Requirements Drift** - Verbal decisions override written specs
- **Collaboration Silos** - AI work isolated from team visibility

### Solution Approach
Claude Code PM solves these by:
- **Persistent Context** - Project state maintained across sessions
- **Parallel Agents** - Multiple work streams executing simultaneously
- **Spec-Driven Development** - Every line traces to requirements
- **GitHub Integration** - Transparent collaboration with human teams

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Workflow management for AI-assisted development
- GitHub Issues as project database
- Parallel AI agent execution system
- Context optimization and preservation
- PRD creation and management
- Task decomposition and tracking
- Installation and setup automation

### Out of Scope
- Actual code generation (handled by Claude Code)
- Project management beyond GitHub Issues
- Alternative VCS support (Git only)
- Cloud-based SaaS offering
- Mobile applications
- Enterprise features (SAML, etc.)

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Reduce Context Switching** - 89% less time lost to context recovery
2. **Increase Parallelism** - Enable 5-8 parallel tasks vs sequential
3. **Improve Quality** - 75% reduction in bug rates through specification
4. **Accelerate Delivery** - Up to 3x faster feature shipping

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Enhance Collaboration** - Seamless human-AI teamwork
2. **Provide Visibility** - Transparent progress tracking
3. **Ensure Traceability** - Complete audit capabilities
4. **Maintain Simplicity** - Easy installation and use

## Success Criteria

### Adoption Metrics
- Installation success rate > 95%
- User retention after 30 days > 80%
- Command usage frequency (daily/weekly)
- Feature utilization across all phases

### Effectiveness Metrics
- Reduced time between sessions
- Increased number of parallel tasks
- Decreased bug rates in projects
- Faster feature completion times

### Quality Metrics
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage maintenance
- Code review improvements
- Requirements traceability

## Target Timeline

### Current Status
- ✅ Core system complete
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive

- **Installation failures** - Mitigation: Multiple installation methods, clear error messages

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning curve** - Mitigation: Comprehensive docs, examples
- **Workflow resistance** - Mitigation: Clear benefits, gradual adoption
- **Team coordination** - Mitigation: Clear guidelines, best practices

## Constraints

### Must Haves
- GitHub integration
- Command-line interface
- Context optimization
- Parallel execution

### Nice to Haves
- GUI interface
- Additional VCS support
- Cloud sync
- Advanced analytics
