# Project Overview

## System Summary

Claude Code PM is a workflow management system that transforms AI-assisted software development through structured processes, parallel execution, and comprehensive traceability. It enables developers to ship better software faster by combining the power of AI with proven project management methodologies.

## Core Features

### 1. Five-Phase Workflow
- **Product Planning**: Guided PRD creation through comprehensive brainstorming
- **Implementation Planning**: Technical architecture and dependency mapping
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking epics into actionable, parallel-ready tasks
- **GitHub Synchronization**: Pushing work to Issues with proper relationships
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple AI agents working simultaneously

### 2. Agent System
- **code-analyzer**: Bug detection and code analysis across multiple files
- **file-analyzer**: Summarization of logs and verbose outputs
- **test-runner**: Test execution with intelligent result analysis
- **parallel-worker**: Coordination of multiple work streams

### 3. Context Management
- **Persistent Storage**: Project context maintained across sessions
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Structured context for different aspects
- **Automatic Loading**: Context primed at session start
- **Optimized Usage**: Minimal context footprint through summarization

### 4. GitHub Integration
- **Issues as Database**: Using GitHub Issues as project management system
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Proper epic and task hierarchies
- **Comment Audit Trail**: Complete history of decisions and progress
- **Label Organization**: Structured categorization of work items

## Current State

## Usage Patterns

### Getting Started
1. Install system in project directory
2. Initialize with `/pm:init`
3. Create context with `/context:create`
4. Start first feature with `/pm:prd-new`

### Daily Workflow
1. Prime context: `/context:prime`
2. Check status: `/pm:status`
3. Get next task: `/pm:next`
4. Execute work: `/pm:issue-start`

### Collaboration
1. Share GitHub repository
2. Real-time progress visibility
3. Comment-based communication
4. Seamless handoffs

## Value Proposition
