# Epic: Bank Regulation Crawler

## Overview

This epic outlines the technical implementation of an automated regulatory document collection and monitoring system for the Bank of China Legal Compliance Department. The system will crawl 6 key Chinese regulatory websites, process various document formats (PDF, HTML, Word, Excel), classify content, provide real-time alerts, and maintain a searchable repository with version control.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for REST API services
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for web interface
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Elasticsearch for full-text search
- **Document Processing**: Apache Tika for content extraction, OpenCV for OCR
- **Crawling Framework**: Scrapy with custom middleware for rate limiting
- **Classification**: scikit-learn with Chinese text processing capabilities
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment consistency
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for system observability

### Key Design Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separate services for crawling, processing, classification, and notifications
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Kafka for async communication between services
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer with interfaces
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable crawlers for different website structures
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time notification system

### Infrastructure Design
- **On-Premises Deployment**: Bank's private cloud environment
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx for API gateway
