# Task: Classification System

## Description
Develop ML-based categorization system for regulatory documents with Chinese text processing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document classification model trained and deployed
- [ ] Support for regulatory categories:
  - Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
  - Capital Management
  - Consumer Protection
  - Risk Management
  - Operational Compliance
  - Market Conduct
- [ ] Chinese text preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Feature extraction from regulatory text
- [ ] Confidence scoring for classifications
- [ ] Manual override interface for corrections
- [ ] Category management system
- [ ] Multi-label classification support
- [ ] Model performance monitoring
- [ ] Classification accuracy > 90%

## Technical Details
- Use scikit-learn with Chinese text processing
- Implement TF-IDF and word embeddings
- Create labeled dataset from historical documents
- Build model training and evaluation pipeline
- Implement model versioning and A/B testing
- Create classification API endpoint
- Build feedback loop for model improvement
- Use BERT or similar for better Chinese understanding

## Dependencies
